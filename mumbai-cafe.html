        <div class="sub-item-user">
            <p >
                I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m
                designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research
                was working adults who have busy schedule.
                <br><br>
                
                This group was generally suffering from shortage of time. During the peak hours, it was difficult for them to find table at any cafe. Sometimes they had to leave due to cafe being packed.

            <p class="description">
                Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paer ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address user pain points. For the homescreen, I prioritized a quick and easy booking process to help users save time.
